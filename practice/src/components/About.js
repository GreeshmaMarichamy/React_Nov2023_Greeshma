    At ToyStore, we take playing very, very seriously. So seriously, that every one of our toys and games has to pass these litmus test questions: Can a child play with this AND learn from this? Is this sustainable, reusable and full of educational utility? Is this different from the local, frail toys/games of cheap quality that are so easily available and so easily trashable? If a toy/game or book positively passes this test, you will definitely find it on this website. With our selection of toys and games, playtime turns into a creative, open-ended experience that contributes to the wholesome growth of the child.
    
    For the last 8 years, we have been carefully selecting the best, most unique toys and games from all corners of the world. We are proud of our toys of unparalleled quality and innovative concepts, games that challenge and entertain, and books that stay with you forever.
    
    But our unparalleled selection of quality toys is just one of many reasons that makes Toycra unique:
    
    We provide toll-free support by our award-winning toy EXPERTS before AND after the sale
    All products we sold come with Toycra assurance that they are genuine and fresh products only.
    We stock every product we sell from our own centrally-located warehouse
    Most in-stock orders are shipped within 24 hours (if not faster!)
